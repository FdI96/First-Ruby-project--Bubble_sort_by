# First Ruby Project!

**This is my first Ruby project for Microverse**

# Getting started :

I built two little bubble sort methods in Ruby. I used a while loop and a "switch button" (true or false b variable) to know when the array is sorted and a "times do" loop to move trough the array and sort it. In this project I'm using all the basics things that I learned to build this sort methods like varibles, loops, conditions, data structure like arrays, methods definition, debugging options, etc.
This project is completely for learning purpose.
