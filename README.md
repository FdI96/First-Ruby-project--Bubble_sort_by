# First Ruby Project!

**This is my first Ruby project for Microverse**

# Getting started :

I built this little bubble sort method in Ruby. I used a while loop and a "switch button" (true or false b variable) to know when the array is sorted and a "times do" loop to move trough the array and sort it.

# Prerequisites :

1- A Computer.

## BUILT WITH

    -RUBY
